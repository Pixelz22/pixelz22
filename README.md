### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Tyler Johnson!

I'm a senior at NC State University pursuing a Master's of Computer Science.
From a young age, I had a passion for video games that bloomed into a passion for computers in general.
Now I spend much of my free time programming personal projects, though my love of video games has pushed me
to delve deep into the world of Game Development, particularly graphics rendering.

I've turned to GitHub as both a portfolio site, as well as a way to save and catalog my favorite projects.
