### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Tyler Johnson!

I'm a junior at NC State University pursuing a Master's of Computer Science.
From a young age, I had a passion for video games that bloomed into a passion for computers in general.
Now I spend much of my free time programming personal projects, though my love of video games has pushed me
